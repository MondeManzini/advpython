    "When the conditional part of an if-statement is long enough to require that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the combination of a two character keyword (i.e. if), plus a single space, plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the subsequent lines of the multiline conditional. This can produce a visual conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the if-statement, which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces. This PEP takes no explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such conditional lines from the nested suite inside the if-statement. \n",

    "### Maximum Line Length\n",
    "Limit all lines to a maximum of **79** characters.\n",

    "Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several files open side-by-side, and works well when using code review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping lines. Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length. For code maintained exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters, provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72).\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backslashes may still be appropriate at times. For example, long, multiple with-statements cannot use implicit continuation, so backslashes are acceptable:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should a Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator?\n",
    "For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line. Here, the eye has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are subtracted:\n",
    "\n",
    "**No:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "          ira_deduction -\n",
    "          student_loan_interest)\n",
    "```\n",
    "To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention. Donald Knuth explains the traditional rule in his Computers and Typesetting series: \"Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations\" [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more readable code:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# easy to match operators with operands\n",
    "income = (gross_wages\n",
    "          + taxable_interest\n",

    "          - student_loan_interest)\n",

    "\n",
    "For Python 3.0 and beyond, the following policy is prescribed for the standard library (see PEP 3131): All identifiers in the Python standard library MUST use ASCII-only identifiers, and SHOULD use English words wherever feasible (in many cases, abbreviations and technical terms are used which aren't English). In addition, string literals and comments must also be in ASCII. The only exceptions are (a) test cases testing the non-ASCII features, and (b) names of authors. Authors whose names are not based on the Latin alphabet (latin-1, ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set) MUST provide a transliteration of their names in this character set.\n",

    "### When to Use Trailing Commas\n",
    "Trailing commas are usually optional, except they are mandatory when making a tuple of one element (and in Python 2 they have semantics for the print statement). For clarity, it is recommended to surround the latter in (technically redundant) parentheses.\n",

    "```\n",
    "When trailing commas are redundant, they are often helpful when a version control system is used, when a list of values, arguments or imported items is expected to be extended over time. The pattern is to put each value (etc.) on a line by itself, always adding a trailing comma, and add the close parenthesis/bracket/brace on the next line. However it does not make sense to have a trailing comma on the same line as the closing delimiter (except in the above case of singleton tuples).\n",

    "## Naming Conventions\n",
    "The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so we'll never get this completely consistent -- nevertheless, here are the currently recommended naming standards. New modules and packages (including third party frameworks) should be written to these standards, but where an existing library has a different style, internal consistency is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overriding Principle\n",
    "Names that are visible to the user as public parts of the API should follow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive: Naming Styles\n",
    "There are a lot of different naming styles. It helps to be able to recognize what naming style is being used, independently from what they are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "`b` (single lowercase letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "`B` (single uppercase letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "`lowercase`\n",
    "\n",
    "`lower_case_with_underscores`\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPPERCASE`\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n",
    "\n",
    "`CapitalizedWords` (or `CapWords`, or `CamelCase` -- so named because of the bumpy look of its letters [4]). This is also sometimes known as `StudlyCaps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When using acronyms in `CapWord`s, capitalize all the letters of the acronym. Thus `HTTPServerError` is better than `HttpServerError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mixedCase` (differs from `CapitalizedWord`s by initial lowercase character!)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores` (ugly!)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related names together. This is not used much in Python, but it is mentioned for completeness. For example, the os.stat() function returns a tuple whose items traditionally have names like `st_mode`, `st_size`, `st_mtime` and so on. (This is done to emphasize the correspondence with the fields of the POSIX system call struct, which helps programmers familiar with that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `X11` library uses a leading `X` for all its public functions. In Python, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute and method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are prefixed with a module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any case convention):\n",
    "\n",
    "`_single_leading_underscore`: weak \"internal use\" indicator. E.g. from M import * does not import objects whose names start with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "`single_trailing_underscore_`: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g.\n",
    "`Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')`\n",
    "\n",
    "`__double_leading_underscore`: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo`; see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "`__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`: \"magic\" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. `__init__`, `__import__` or `__file__`. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prescriptive: Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Names to Avoid\n",
    "Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ASCII Compatibility\n",
    "Identifiers used in the standard library must be ASCII compatible as described in the policy section of PEP 3131.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package and Module Names\n",
    "Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. _socket).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Names\n",
    "Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Variable Names\n",
    "Names of type variables introduced in `PEP 484` should normally use `CapWords` preferring short names: `T`, `AnyStr`, `Num`. It is recommended to add suffixes `_co` or `_contra` to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behavior correspondingly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypeVar\n",
    "\n",
    "VT_co = TypeVar('VT_co', covariant=True)\n",
    "KT_contra = TypeVar('KT_contra', contravariant=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exception Names\n",
    "Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix \"Error\" on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Variable Names\n",
    "(Let's hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module only.) The conventions are about the same as those for functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules that are designed for use via `from M import *` should use the `__all__` mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the older convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which you might want to do to indicate these globals are \"module non-public\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function and Variable Names\n",
    "Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names follow the same convention as function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mixedCase` is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function and Method Arguments\n",
    "Always use `self` for the first argument to instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use `cls` for the first argument to class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Names and Instance Variables\n",
    "Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named `__a`, it cannot be accessed by `Foo.__a`. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling `Foo._Foo__a`.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: there is some controversy about the use of `__names` (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants\n",
    "Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include `MAX_OVERFLOW` and `TOTAL`.\n"

With MonkeyType, it's very easy to add annotations that reflect the concrete types you use at runtime, but those annotations may not always match the full intended capability of the functions. For instance, add is capable of handling many more types than just integers. Similarly, MonkeyType may generate a concrete List annotation where an abstract Sequence or Iterable would be more appropriate. MonkeyType's annotations are an informative first draft, to be checked and corrected by a developer."

    "- The main principle behind writing a context manager is that you're writing code that's meant to surround a block of statements as defined by the use of the with statement. When the with statement is first encountered, the `__enter__()` method is triggered. The return value of `__enter__()` (if any) is placed into the variable indicated with the as qualifier. Afterward, the statements in the body of the with statement execute. Finally, the `__exit__()` method is triggered to clean up.\n",

    "- This control flow happens regardless of what happens in the body of the with statement, including if there are exceptions. In fact, the three arguments to the `__exit__()` method contain the exception type, value, and traceback for pending exceptions (if any). The `__exit__()` method can choose to use the exception information in some way or to ignore it by doing nothing and returning None as a result. If `__exit__()` returns True, the exception is cleared as if nothing happened and the program continues executing statements immediately after the with block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One subtle aspect of this recipe is whether or not the LazyConnection class allows nested use of the connection with multiple with statements. As shown, only a single socket connection at a time is allowed, and an exception is raised if a repeated with statement is attempted when a socket is already in use. You can work around this limitation with a slightly different implementation, as shown here:"

    "In this second version, the LazyConnection class serves as a kind of factory for connections. Internally, a list is used to keep a stack. Whenever `__enter__()` executes, it makes a new connection and adds it to the stack. The `__exit__()` method simply pops the last connection off the stack and closes it. It's subtle, but this allows multiple connections to be created at once with nested with statements, as shown.\n",

    "Context managers are most commonly used in programs that need to manage resources such as files, network connections, and locks. A key part of such resources is they have to be explicitly closed or released to operate correctly. For instance, if you acquire a lock, then you have to make sure you release it, or else you risk deadlock. By implementing `__enter__()`, `__exit__()`, and using the with statement, it is much easier to avoid such problems, since the cleanup code in the `__exit__()` method is guaranteed to run no matter what.\n",

If the body of your loop is simple, the interpreter overhead of the for loop itself can be a substantial amount of the overhead. This is where the map function is handy. You can think of map as a for moved into C code. The only restriction is that the \"loop body\" of map must be a function call. Besides the syntactic benefit of list comprehensions, they are often as fast or faster than equivalent use of map."

In particular, it decides whether or not to let another thread run and whether or not to run a pending call (typically a call established by a signal handler). Most of the time there's nothing to do, so performing these checks each pass around the interpreter loop can slow things down. There is a function in the sys module, setcheckinterval, which you can call to tell the interpreter how often to perform these periodic checks. Prior to the release of Python 2.3 it defaulted to 10. In 2.3 this was raised to 100. If you aren't running with threads and you don't expect to be catching many signals, setting this to a larger value can improve the interpreter's performance, sometimes substantially."
